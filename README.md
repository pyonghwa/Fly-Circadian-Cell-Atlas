# Fly Circadian Cell Atlas

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and scripts used for the analyses in our study:
["A Time-Resolved Single-Nucleus Atlas of Circadian Transcription in the Drosophila Head"](https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx).

Read alignment and generation of gene and exon count matrices were performed using the [EasySci](https://github.com/JunyueCaoLab/EasySci.git) pipeline.
